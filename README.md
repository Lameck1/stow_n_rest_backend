## About Project

The aim of this project is to provide a RESTful API that will help manage data for service providers who offer limited time storage space solutions to their customers. The future prospects of this project are to provide a way for customers to request for luggage shipment at specified dates when they've deposited their luggage at any of the authorized Stow and Rest dealers.
